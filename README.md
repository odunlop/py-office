# Learning Python: Office Management Challenge
As part of my first week learning Python, this repo was created to attempt an old challenge I have already completed in Ruby but in Python instead :snake:

## General Info
* Developed using...
    - Python 3.9
    - unittest
* Designed so employees can check if a meeting room is busy or occupied

## Functionality
### MeetingRoom class
- Has a name which can be accessed :white_check_mark:
- Check avaliability (True or False) :white_check_mark:
- Start meeting, making the room unavaliable :white_check_mark:
    - Receive an error if you try to start a meeting in an occupied room
- End meeting, making the room free

### Office class
- Add meeting rooms to an office :white_check_mark:
- List all the meeting rooms in an office :white_check_mark:
- List of all avaliable offices :construction:
